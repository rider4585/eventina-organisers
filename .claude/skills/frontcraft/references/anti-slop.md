# Anti-slop — killing the "this looks AI-generated" tells

The gap between *looks AI-generated* and *looks designed* is a known, finite set
of tells. Avoid them on purpose. None of these fire automatically — read the brief,
then apply what fits. When a brief explicitly asks for one of these looks, the
brief wins; just don't *default* into them.

## Start with a Design Read (one line)

Before building, say it in one sentence: **"Reading this as: <page kind> for
<audience>, in a <vibe> direction."** A page that names its own intent doesn't
retreat to a generic default. This is the cheapest quality move there is.

## The three default looks to avoid as a reach

AI design clusters into three looks that show up regardless of subject:
1. Warm cream background (~#F4F1EA) + high-contrast serif + terracotta accent.
2. Near-black + a single acid-green or vermilion accent.
3. Broadsheet hairline rules + zero border-radius + dense newspaper columns.

All three are fine *when the brief asks for them*. As an unprompted default for
every project, they're a tell. Spend a free aesthetic axis on a real choice instead.

**Run this check against the _finished_ build, not just the brief — name which of
the three your result is closest to.** The most-missed one is #2: a dark
navy/charcoal/near-black background with a single bright accent **reads as default
"dark-SaaS" slop**, and *cyan, teal, and electric blue count as the "acid" accent*
every bit as much as acid-green or vermilion. A dark theme with one glowing accent
is not automatically "premium/cinematic" — by default it's the tell. And escaping
a default look is **not** a slightly different dark shade or a new accent hue; it's
committing to an art-directed *identity*: a palette and type with real character,
and **photography carrying the page**. When a dark build reads generic, the
fastest, most reliable exit is usually the opposite move — a light, image-led
editorial layout (white/paper, a characterful display face, one warm accent, big
verified photos) where the pictures do the work. If you can't name a real reason
the build is dark-with-a-bright-accent, treat it as look #2 and redesign.

## Typography tells

- **Don't default to a serif because it "feels premium/editorial."** That instinct
  is the single most-tested AI tell. Default to a characterful grotesque/sans
  display unless the brand is genuinely editorial / luxury / heritage / publication
  and you can say why.
- **Fraunces and Instrument Serif** are the two most over-reached AI display
  serifs. Avoid them as defaults; if a serif is justified, pick a less-worn one.
- **Emphasis inside a headline** = italic or bold of the *same* family. Never inject
  a lone serif word into a sans headline (or vice versa) for "interest."
- **Don't tint a single word a different hue for "pop."** A lone accent-colored word
  dropped into a headline or running text reads as a cheap template move, not
  emphasis. Emphasis is italic or weight of the *same* family in the *same* color;
  keep the accent for the CTA and small UI, off the prose.
- **Inter** is fine only when a neutral / Linear-style feel is the actual goal.

## Color tells

- **One accent, locked across the whole page.** No second accent appearing in
  section 7. No teal status badge on a rose-accented site.
- **Tinted neutrals**, never flat `#000` / `#fff` or default `#888`.
- **No AI purple→blue gradient** by default.
- **Premium-consumer briefs** (cookware, wellness, artisan, luxury, DTC home):
  avoid the auto beige + brass + oxblood + espresso palette. Rotate to something
  specific (cold luxury, forest, black-and-tan, cobalt+cream, terracotta+slate,
  monochrome + one saturated pop).

## Layout tells

- **No "centered hero + three equal text cards"** as a default. Vary spans, go
  asymmetric, pick one focal point. (Image-led card grids are fine — empty text
  boxes are the problem.)
- **Zigzag cap:** at most 2 consecutive image+text split rows. The 3rd is a tell.
- **Section-layout variety:** across ~8 sections use at least 4 different layout
  families. "Selected work" must not look like "What we do."
- **Hero fits the viewport:** headline ≤ 2 lines, subtext ≤ ~20 words, primary CTA
  visible without scrolling. Plan font size and image size together.
- **Hero stack discipline:** ≤ ~4 text elements (one small label OR brand strip,
  headline, subtext, CTAs). No trust micro-strip, tagline, or feature bullets
  crammed into the hero — those move to sections below it.
- **A long list is a layout choice, not a default.** More than ~5 items wants a
  *different component*, not a longer list: a 2-column grouped split, a card grid
  with image + label, tabs/accordion, scroll-snap pills, or a marquee. A spec sheet
  of 10 rows each under a hairline rule is the worst default — chunk it, feature the
  top 3–5 with a "view all", or move it to its own page.
- **No data-dump sections on a marketing page.** A 30-row award list, a giant
  pricing matrix, a full publication table — show the top few plus "view full
  list", or link a dedicated page. Don't paste the database onto the landing page.
- **Logo wall goes *under* the hero, never inside it**, and it's logos only — no
  `Vercel · hosting` category label tacked under each one.

## Structural-decoration tells (the small stuff that screams AI)

- **Eyebrows: at most 1 per 3 sections.** Not a small uppercase label over every
  section header. Often the headline alone is enough.
- **No section-number eyebrows** (`00 / INDEX`, `001 · Capabilities`, `06 · how it
  works`).
- **No decorative status dots** before nav items, list rows, or badges (only for
  real semantic state).
- **No scroll cues** (`Scroll`, `↓ scroll`, "Scroll to explore").
- **No locale / time / weather strips** ("Lisbon 14:23 · 18°C") unless the brand is
  genuinely place- or timezone-specific.
- **No version labels in the hero** (`V0.6`, `BETA`, `EARLY ACCESS`) unless it's a
  launch.
- **No pills/labels overlaid on photos; no decorative photo-credit captions.**
- **Numbering (01 / 02 / 03)** only when the content is a real sequence (a process,
  a route, a timeline) — not as decoration. **Never on a filterable/sortable grid:**
  the moment a filter hides items the visible numbers go non-contiguous (`06`, `07`
  floating with gaps), which reads as a bug, not a flourish.

## More tells the review panel keeps catching

These show up once the obvious ones are gone. They're the second layer — the moves
the model reaches for when it's *trying to look designed*. Let the review-agent loop
surface them on each build and fold new ones in here over time. None fire
automatically; kill them only when they're an unprompted reach.

- **Middle-dot (`·`) overuse.** Ration it to ~1 per metadata line. It is not the
  universal separator for everything (`foo · bar · baz · qux`). Prefer line breaks,
  hairlines, or columns when you need to separate more than two things.
- **Decoration strip across the hero bottom** (`BRAND. MOTION. SPATIAL.`,
  `TYPE / FORM / MOTION`, `ESTD. 2018 · LISBON`). An agency-portfolio cliché. Allowed
  only when the strip is real navigation or real status, not atmosphere.
- **Floating corner paragraph in a section header.** Giant left headline with a tiny
  explainer paragraph floating top-right, aligned to nothing. Either stack headline
  over body (max ~65ch), or build a real two-column header where the right column
  carries a visual — not a stray paragraph.
- **Poetic-craftsman labels.** `From the field`, `Field notes`, `On our desks`,
  `Loose plates`, "Quietly trusted by". Use plain functional labels (`Testimonials`,
  `Latest writing`, `Trusted by`) or drop the label.
- **Micro-meta sentences under a heading.** A little sentence explaining the section
  to itself ("This is a feature we ship today, not a roadmap promise") is clutter.
  Eyebrow (if any) + headline + body is enough.
- **Generic step labels.** `Stage 1 / Stage 2`, `Phase 01 / 02 / 03`, `Step 1 / 2 / 3`.
  The step's actual content is the label — use the verb (`Install`, `Configure`,
  `Ship`), not "Step 1: Install".
- **`<br>`-broken, italicized headlines** as a default "design move". Headlines
  should read naturally first; get clever only when the brief asks for it.
- **Vertical rotated text** and **crosshair / hairline grid lines drawn just to
  "feel designed".** Use them only when they organize real content.
- **Filled-track scoring/progress bars** as comparison visuals on a marketing page,
  and **live-stock counters** (`Reservation 412 of 800`) or **version footers**
  (`v1.4.2`, `Build 0048`, `last sync 4s ago`) on marketing/portfolio pages. These
  are devtool/dashboard fixtures, not landing-page content.
- **Custom mouse cursors** are high-risk (accessibility, performance, touch). Treat
  as a deliberate, justified choice for an experimental brief — never a default
  flourish.
- **Headlines that only scream.** Don't reach straight for the biggest size; control
  hierarchy with weight, color, and space too. And no gradient-filled display text as
  a default.

## The em-dash ban (in shipped UI copy)

In anything the user reads on the page — headlines, labels, body, quotes,
captions, buttons, alt text — do not use the em-dash (`—`) or en-dash (`–`) as a
separator. It's a strong AI tell. Use a normal hyphen, a comma, a period, a colon,
or restructure the sentence. (This is about shipped copy, not internal docs.)

## Content & copy tells

- **Real copy, never lorem ipsum.** Write plausible content for the actual subject.
- **No generic names** ("Jane Doe", "John Doe") or **startup-slop brands** ("Acme",
  "Nexus", "SmartFlow"). Use believable, specific, locale-appropriate names.
- **No filler verbs** ("Elevate", "Seamless", "Unleash", "Next-Gen",
  "Revolutionize"). Concrete verbs only.
- **No fake-precise numbers** (`99.99%`, `4.1×`) unless they're real or labelled as
  sample data.
- **Re-read every visible string before shipping.** Cut cute-but-broken AI phrasing
  and forced wordplay; plain and correct beats clever and wrong.
- **Default content shape per section:** a short headline (≤ ~8 words) + a short
  sub-paragraph (≤ ~25 words) + one visual *or* one CTA. If a section needs more,
  it's probably two sections.
- **One copy register per page.** Don't mix clipped technical-mono labels, flowery
  editorial prose, and punchy marketing voice in the same site — pick the voice the
  brand uses and hold it, the same way you hold one palette.
- **Testimonials are snippets, not essays.** ≤ 3 lines of quote; if the real review
  is longer, cut it to the sharp part. Attribution is always name + role (+ company
  where it matters), never a bare "— Sarah". Use real typographic quotes (`" "`),
  and no em-dashes inside the quote text.
- **Write from the user's side of the screen.** Name things by what the person
  controls ("Notifications", not "Webhook config"). Buttons say what happens
  ("Save changes", not "Submit"), and an action keeps its name through the flow
  (a "Publish" button produces a "Published" toast). Empty and error states give
  direction in the interface's voice, not an apology or a mood.

## Real images, not fakes

- **No div-based fake screenshots / dashboards / terminals** built from styled
  boxes. Use a real screenshot, a generated image, or a real component preview.
- **The hero needs a real visual**, not a gradient blob.
- Sourcing + verification: see `SKILL.md` → Images (project assets → Pexels →
  keyless Unsplash, every image verified).

## Interactive states & accessibility

- Design **hover / focus-visible / active / disabled / loading / empty / error**,
  not just the happy path.
- **Button text passes WCAG AA** against its background; **CTA labels don't wrap**
  at desktop; **no two CTAs with the same intent** on one page.

## Mechanical pre-flight (just count)

- Closest of the 3 default looks to the finished build: **name it.** If it *is*
  one (especially dark + a single bright/cyan/teal/acid accent) and the brief
  didn't ask for it: **redesign**, don't ship.
- Em-dashes in shipped copy: **0**
- Eyebrows / small uppercase section labels: **≤ ceil(sections / 3)**
- Distinct layout families (6+ section page): **≥ 4**
- Accent colors: **1**
- Middle-dot (`·`) separators per metadata line: **≤ 1**
- Marquees / kinetic scroll strips: **≤ 1**
- Custom cursors, vertical rotated text, hero decoration strips (unbriefed): **0**
- Dead `#` links or placeholder buttons: **0**
- Lorem ipsum / Jane Doe / Acme: **0**
- Distinct themes on the page: **1** (sections tint within one family; they don't invert)
- Corner-radius scales in use: **1** (or one documented per-element rule, held everywhere)
- Empty/half-filled bento or grid cells: **0**
- Italic display words with clipped descenders: **0**
- Lists over ~5 items left as a plain long list: **0** (use a real component)

If a count is off, fix it before the review panel runs. This pairs with the core
`SKILL.md` pre-flight, not replaces it.
